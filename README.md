The CRM project is a customer relationship management system developed using the Django web framework with a frontend powered by HTML and CSS. It aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing customer data and relationships, offering functionalities such as registration, login, logout, adding records, viewing records, updating records, and deleting records. The backend uses MySQL as the database, ensuring a robust and secure data management system.

Advantages and Main Functionality:
Django Web Framework: Leveraging the Django framework ensures a robust and secure backend. Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) facilitates seamless database operations, simplifying the process of managing customer data.

User Authentication: The CRM system incorporates Django's built-in user authentication system, providing a secure way for users to register, log in, and log out. This ensures that only authorized users can access and manipulate customer data.

Clean and Scalable Code Structure: Django encourages a clean and scalable code structure, making it easier to maintain and extend the application over time. This is particularly valuable for long-term projects or those with evolving requirements.

MySQL Database: The decision to use MySQL as the database offers reliability and scalability. MySQL is a widely-used relational database management system, providing a solid foundation for storing and retrieving customer data.
